## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Final thoughts

I'm happy with the result. I'm happy with the styling. I'm happy with the responsiveness. I'm happy with the navigation.

I think that I did a good work talking about HTML and CSS (more precisely in SASS), but I still have A LOT to learn from both and not to mention acquiring good practices.

Regarding to JavaScript, I am not sure if my code in this project is completely correct, but I have too much to learn of that too, even more than HTML and CSS.
